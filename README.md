Voice-to-Text Translation App
This Python application lets you **speak into a microphone** and automatically 
**translates** what you say into a different language. It then creates an **audio file** with 
the translated text so you can listen to it. 
**What This App Does:** 
 **Listens to your voice** and converts it into text. 
 **Detects the language** of what you said. 
 **Translates** the text into another language of your choice. 
 **Saves the translated text** as an audio file. 
 **Plays the translated audio** so you can hear it. 
**What You Need Before Using It:** 
 **Python 3.7 or newer** installed on your computer. 
 A working **microphone**. 
 The following Python libraries installed (you can install them using `pip`): 
 ```
 pip install speech_recognition googletrans==4.0.0-rc1 gtts
 ``` 
**How to Use the App:** 
1⃣Open your **command prompt** or **terminal**. 
2️⃣Run the script by typing: 
 ```
 python app.py
 ``` 
3⃣Enter the **language** you want your speech translated into (e.g., Hindi, Telugu, Tamil). 
4⃣Speak when prompted. The app will: 
 - Convert your speech to text. 
 - Detect the language of what you said. 
 - Translate it into your selected language. 
 - Generate an **audio file** with the translated speech. 
5️⃣The translated **audio file will play automatically** (if supported on your system). 
**Supported Languages:** 
This app can translate your voice into the following languages: 
- **Hindi** (hi) 
- **Telugu** (te) 
- **Kannada** (kn) 
- **Tamil** (ta) 
- **Malayalam** (ml) 
- **Bengali** (bn) 
**Files in This Project:** 
 `app.py` → The main Python script. 
 `requirements.txt` → A list of required libraries. 
 `outputs/` → A folder where translated audio files are saved. 
**Things to Keep in Mind:** 
 The **Google Translate** service (`googletrans`) may sometimes fail due to network 
issues. If translation doesn’t work, check your **internet connection** and try again. 
 Make sure the **outputs** folder exists or the script will create it when saving audio 
files. 
This app makes it **easy to translate speech** into another language and listen to the 
result!
